    <p>India Gate is a famous war memorial located in New Delhi, built in 1931 to honor Indian soldiers who died in World War I and the Afghan Wars. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, it stands 42 meters tall and is made of red sandstone. The *Amar Jawan Jyoti*, an eternal flame, was added after independence to honor fallen soldiers. Surrounded by green lawns, it is a major tourist attraction and a symbol of Indiaâ€™s pride and sacrifice.
