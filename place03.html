    <p>The Red Fort, located in Delhi, is a historic fort built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1639. Made of red sandstone, it served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years. The fort is known for its massive walls, beautiful gates, and intricate Mughal architecture. It holds great national importance, as India’s Prime Minister hoists the national flag here every Independence Day. Today, the Red Fort stands as a symbol of India’s rich history and cultural heritage.
